## Motivation
While working with HLS offline download and playback, I was faced with the need to process cases with a fully filled iPhone/iPad storage. If you need to process cases like this, so feel free to use an app.

Inspired by [@boehlerlukas](https://github.com/boehlerlukas)

## Tech

- System: iOS 13.0+
- Architectire: MVVM
- Pure SwiftUI & Combine & Async/await without any external libraries.

## TODO

- [ ] Add alerts when space storage operations have ended
- [ ] Add spinners that indicates which operation is performing (inside of buttons)
